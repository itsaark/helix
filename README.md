# Helix

DNA is a very sensitive and personal information. I believe that DNA sequencing, storage,
and distribution should be completely anonymous.

Helix is an attempt to create a blockchain to store and retrieve DNA anonymously.


### Running
Once you are inside the directory. `Cargo build` and `Cargo run` should start
running the program.
